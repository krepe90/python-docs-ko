"The modules described in this chapter have been superseded by other "
"modules for most use cases, and are retained primarily to preserve "
"backwards compatibility."
msgstr "이 장에서 설명하는 모듈은 대부분의 사용 사례에서 다른 모듈로 대체되었으며, 주로 하위 호환성을 유지하기 위해 유지됩니다."

"Modules may appear in this chapter because they only cover a limited "
"subset of a problem space, and a more generally applicable solution is "
"available elsewhere in the standard library (for example, :mod:`getopt` "
"covers the very specific task of \"mimic the C :c:func:`!getopt` API in "
"Python\", rather than the broader command line option parsing and "
"argument parsing capabilities offered by :mod:`optparse` and "
":mod:`argparse`)."

msgid ""
"Alternatively, modules may appear in this chapter because they are "
"deprecated outright, and awaiting removal in a future release, or they "
"are :term:`soft deprecated` and their use is actively discouraged in new "
"projects. With the removal of various obsolete modules through "
":pep:`594`, there are currently no modules in this latter category."
